## TruMedia Networks MLB Hackathon web app

###Overview
This project is my entry into the TruMedia MLB Hackathon. It is a web application built using AngularJS as the front-end JavaScript framework, ASP.NET MVC WebAPI as the web service, and Entity Framework as the data access layer. The data is stored in SQL Azure. For the purposes of this Hackathon, the project is hosted at http://tmn-app.azurewebsites.net/. 

###Details
The app is a pitcher scouting report. It displays pitch breakdown charts for each batter hand by pitch type and count, as well as tables and charts showing average release velocity, average spin rate, and swinging strike rate by pitch type for each batter hand.
